# CMPM120_Fish-Patrol
## Original Code
This project was a modification of the "Rocket Patrol Mod" recreation tutorial from github.com/nathanaltice

## Assignment
A lot of the framework is pre-exsiting code written by Nathan from his Rocket Patrol Mod (as part of the assignment), but there are modifications I wrote such as assets changes,
the parallax effect in the background, as well as minor mechanic changes from the original game.
